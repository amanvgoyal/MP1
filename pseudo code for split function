// we pass the size(let it be S) of the block that we need to give to the user.

calculate the index[i] for the rrequired memory in the free table
check free
    while(freelist[i]->free !=true)
        i++;
        
    int temp = freelist[i]->size;
    
    while(temp!=S){
      go to the block which that index points  to // freelist[i];
        now find buddy
        put the buddy address in next of the address which we have taken from free list
        change the size in header in both of the  blocks to be temp/2
        now put the address of the block which we took from free list to i-1 of free list
        and make the header of free list [i]=null
        and if (temp/2==S)
            call the allocate function
        i--;
        }
