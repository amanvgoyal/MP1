// we pass the size(let it be S) of the block that we need to give to the user.

calculate the index[i] for the rrequired memory in the free table
check free
    while(freelist[i]->free !=true)
        i++;
        
    int temp = freelist[i]->size;
    
    while(temp!=S)
      go to the block which that index points to
        now find buddy()
