//i assume that when user frees the memory he tells us the address of the block which he wants to be freed

we make bool free of the block true, 

and then we call the join function from this function only.

and we pass that memory address to the join function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
join function


this join function will find the buddy of the block that has been passed to it
then it will check if it's bool free
if it's false 
    then it will check the size of the block and will find it's index in the free table

            it will check the free bool of that index in the free list.

                     if that is true 
                         it will simply put the block address at that index position.
          
                     else 
                        it will go toh that block and go the next block it points till it find's the block with the next pointer
                        as null and then it makes the next pointer to point th the memory block that user just freed.
else

//if it's buddy block is free
then in doubles the size integer in the header of the passed block.

then it again calls the join function with this address.

//note: we'll be needing to some changes to these functions so they don't fail at the boundy counsitions.
